these are settings to run a test with 2 types of people

 A: who has speed 2
 B: who has speed 4 

the populations are set quite small initially -- 10 each -- and the resources
set to make it possible that around 60 could survive

the effect: B drives A to extinction ( on day 1970)

TO RUN
------

the needed files are

 People_tester.cpp
 Resource.cpp
 world_setup.cpp
 Makefile
 
these should be copied to the main directory (NB: possibly saving elsewhwere any customised versions of these
files that have been made there)

 make People_tester
 ./People_tester

outcomes files in /tmp/Toss

   sim_setup	 
   r_stats		 
   pop_snapshots	 
   starvation_stats 
   gains_info       



People_tester.cpp
-----------------

set to run 2500 iterations

randomisation is left to default setting, so repeats will give same outcomes

activating the line

 sim_params.random_seed_policy = "via_time";

makes repeat runs make different random choices

may want to activate

  sim_params.time_stamp = true; // default is false

if want to keep and disinguish such randomly different outcomes


world_setup.cpp and Resource.cpp
--------------------------------

the populations are set quite small -- 10 each

resources 

 5 areas  each with p_wipeout = 0.00
 5  locations in each
 2 patches of each crop-type at each location
 each patch yields 100

most of this is controlled by code in world_setup.cpp

the exception is p_wipeout, which is set in Resource.cpp
