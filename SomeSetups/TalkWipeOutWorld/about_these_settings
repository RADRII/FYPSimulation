these are settings to run a test with 2 types of people

 A: who retain_info, about wipe_outs, but do not impart_info (ie. communicate)
 B: who retain_info, about wipe_outs, and also do impart_info

the populations are set quite large -- 40 each -- and the resources
are expanded to make it possible that around this amount of people could survive (and to have occasional wipeouts)

the effect: B drives A to extinction ( on day 16025)

TO RUN
------

the needed files are

 People_tester.cpp
 Resource.cpp
 world_setup.cpp
 Makefile
 
these should be copied to the main directory (NB: possibly saving elsewhwere any customised versions of these
files that have been made there)

 make People_tester
 ./People_tester

outcomes files in /tmp/Toss

   sim_setup	 
   r_stats		 
   pop_snapshots	 
   starvation_stats 
   gains_info       



People_tester.cpp
-----------------

set to run 25000 iterations

randomisation is left to default setting, so repeats will give same outcomes

activating the line

 sim_params.random_seed_policy = "via_time";

makes repeat runs make different random choices

may want to activate

  sim_params.time_stamp = true; // default is false

if want to keep and disinguish such randomly different outcomes


world_setup.cpp and Resource.cpp
--------------------------------

the populations are set quite large -- 40 each -- and the resources set up 
so around this amount of people could survive

 5 areas  each with p_wipeout = 0.01
 10 locations in each
 2 patches of each crop-type at each location
 each patch yields 100

most of this is controlled by code in world_setup.cpp

the exception is p_wipeout, which is set in Resource.cpp
